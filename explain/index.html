My father is a lawyer in the Indian Air force officer. We were uprooted every three years, traveling to different corners of our country. Today, I am a true child of the Indian subcontinent: I can fit in any new place with relative ease. Having to fend for me in new environments since a young age gave me a tremendous sense of independence. I have been guilty on many occasions of wanting to share this liberating(intoxicating) sense of independence with people, often encouraging them to break out of their comfort zone, standing up for classmates being bullied and helping those in need to the best of my ability. I am applying to a fellowship like Palaksha because I do not want to remain a cog in a big corporate machine. I want to create a product for myself, lead and be my own boss. 

My sense to succeed when I grew up was very strong. Whichever school I went to, I managed to stand in the top 3 if not the first every time. I carried my motivation to my JEE preparations and got an All India Rank of 190 in 2015 Mains exams. Despite having a choice between NIT Warangal, the best in CS in NITs, and IIIT Delhi, an upcoming college just established 8yrs ago, I decided to go with IIITD. This is the first major decision I took by myself in my life. Delhi being the capital, I viewed it as an opportunity for self-development outside college. College is not only a place of studies but also of learning about the outside world. Getting to know about IIITD’s foremost research culture helped finalize my decision. In these four years in Delhi, I have grown tremendously as a person. I have took part in countless soirees around Delhi on Politics, Art, Startups and all things tech. 

Starting as a non-programmer, my learning curve in computer science has been very steep- within 2 years of starting to code, our team of 3 cleared the ACM ICPC India finals, making us among the top 60 competitive coding teams in the country. The following summer I interned at Adobe as their youngest intern. I was fortunate to get a project and team where I could brainstorm and come up with my own idea and prototype. I loved my experience because of the independence it gave me. Having used ML practically on a real world problem right off the bat, I grew very interested in pursuing this field.

The next sem, I also got involved in a startup (Invadex) as a Research Head. Our idea was to consult with non-tech companies and provide machine learning solutions to boost their sales and user experience for the Indian customer. Within two months, with the startup still in nascent stages, we applied to showcase our idea at the Web Summit'17, Europe’s largest tech summit in Lisbon, Portugal. We were selected for their early stage startup cohort and were offered a place to pitch our idea and network. 

The following summer I was invited back to intern with Adobe. This time too my work was not cut out for me in the team. I was asked to brainstorm about a novel application or feature for any product that falls in the domain of the team and implement it. My idea and prototype was so liked that they are including it in the roadmap for 2019. While leaving, I remember, my product manager came up to me and even suggest that I consider the role of a product manager because of the ideas I came up with and the attitude I showed in the initial brainstorming sessions. 

However, this time, the experience was no longer new to me. The observations which slipped through the cracks last time because of my excitement slipped came at me at full force. I realised to a certain extent, that I would always be working on a product that someone else made and how much ever the illusion of independence was given, ultimately, the ones that we create as regular employees, are ones that are dictated by senior management and only fall under the umbrella of ones which impact the product. I realized that I want to be free to work on my own problems and, if interested, diversify them. Hence, my second internship at the same company helped me realize that my independence went further than just being able to survive on my own and solving my own problems; it meant the freedom to do and work on my problems as well. It was then that the idea of the startup that I had taken up and suspended until my education started looking like a long-term career opportunity.
